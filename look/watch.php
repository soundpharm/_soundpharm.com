			<h1>Interactive and Motion-based Media</h1>
			
			<h3>The Franchise King</h3>
			<a href="http://www.thefranchiseking.com/" target="_blank">www.thefranchiseking.com</a> - spring 2009<br />
			I have had the pleasure to work with <a href="http://www.joellibava.com/" target="_blank">Joel Libava</a> on several of his franchise blogs. In the spring of 2009 I designed a site for him that would tie together several of his primary blogs. We nailed down some guidelines and I created a design the fit Joel's request. The site is hosted on TypePad and was set up to allow Joel to maintain nearly all aspects of the content.

			<h3>Wilkins and Company</h3>
			<a href="http://www.wilkinscompany.com/" target="_blank">www.wilkinscompany.com</a> - January 2008<br />
			A request came to me from <a href="http://www.markpoprocki.com" target="_blank">Mark Poprocki</a> to set up a flash-based site to market Carol Wilkens Cotman's media relations and event planning services. Mark worked with Carol to design the site and I handled putting everything online. The Flash aspect was a great way to keep my interactive skills fresh.

			<h3>Be Your Own Pet!</h3>
			<a href="http://www.beyourownpet.net" target="_blank">www.beyourownpet.net</a> - Fabruary-March 2008<br />
			I helped <a href="http://takes.us/" target="_blank">Rob Boles</a>, a former co-worker, bring to life a web site for the band Be Your Own Pet! Typical to our previous relationship at DigiKnow, Rob created the design and I implemented the HTML/CSS site construction. Rob's design called for a complex set of layered semi-transparent images, custom text treatment and scalable content areas.

			<h3>Chop Chop Gallery Website</h3>
			<a href="http://www.chopchopgallery.com" target="_blank">www.chopchopgallery.com</a> - October 2006 and redesign in fall 2008<br />
			Site designed by Craig Dransfield. I did production and layout for the site, turning Craig's concepts into pages. Craig and Ashley started the gallery/studio space/store/skate place (& often car shop) in the summer of '06. Their dedication and hard work have produced a wonderful environment for creativity.

			<h3>Skatepharm.com</h3>
			<a href="http://www.skatepharm.com/" target="_blank">www.skatepharm.com</a> - spring 2009<br />
			I originally designed the site in 2007 but revised the design in early 2009. The site features photos of skateboarding taken by Justin and Nikki.
