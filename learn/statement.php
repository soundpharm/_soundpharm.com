			<strong>RULE #1: Change...The one reliable constant in this world.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Through experimentation I spontaneously create the majority of my artwork. Beginning 
			with a simple shape, line or even concept, the initial event commands 
			an evolution of steps that end in the final piece. I let chance play heavily 
			in the beginning of a painting and evaluate where the piece needs to go 
			as each stage is reached. In this manner the art actually creates itself 
			with only a loose guidance from me to keep it coherent. The imagery often 
			reflects the process from which it was created, showing signs of repetition, 
			illusion, symmetry and iteration. The process itself is a combination 
			of ideas stemming from my interests in Chaos, Geometry and Surrealism. 
			I feel the combination of these concepts reflect much of the processes 
			of life. The near predictability of chaos resides between the rigid structure 
			of geometry and the loose illogic of the surreal. Almost anywhere you 
			look in nature, traces of chaos are revealed as the structural guide. 
			I find great beauty in the representation of chaos and feel that there 
			is much still to be discovered through experimenting with it's concepts.

			My artistic direction has been influenced greatly by the diversity of mediums 
			which I have been fortunate to be exposed to in life. Thanks to the encouragement 
			of my wife, family and friends I have found myself expressing ideas through ceramics, 
			paint, photography, metal, wood, countless industrial processes, music, 
			interactive design and computer imagery of all kinds. Graduating from Columbus 
			College of Art &amp; Design in Dec. of 1997, I spent time there in Industrial 
			Design, Fine Arts and Photography, finally majoring in Time-based Media Studies. 
			Each major and medium has provided me with a different way of 
			perceiving the concepts that are important to me. All helped me recognize 
			strong ideas that I may focus on in future works. I am currently immersed 
			in web-based design, water color and music.
